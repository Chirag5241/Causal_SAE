# Probing Linguistic Properties of SAEs

## Repository Overview

This repository combines code from two existing repositories:
- [openai/sparse_autoencoder](https://github.com/openai/sparse_autoencoder)
- [ahdavies6/causal_probing](https://github.com/ahdavies6/causal_probing)

## My Contributions

I wrote the following notebooks for the MATS application:

1. `extract_embeddings.ipynb` - Notebook get create a subset of the data (borrowed code from causal probing)
2. `interventions_on_residual.ipynb` - Implementation of causal interventions on residual connections
3. `interventions_on_residual_first_pass.ipynb` - Initial exploration of residual stream interventions (old copy of interventions_on_residual)
4. `task_analysis.ipynb` - Task analysis to help with task and data selection (borrowed code from Exploratory Analysis)
5. `transformer_lens_understand.ipynb` - Explanatory notebook for using TransformerLens
